# Who am I?

## **Origin**
### I was born in [*Armenia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia), in the capital city [*Jerevan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerevan). I was born on September 12th 2008. Thus inferring, that in less than a month I will be turning 16 years old.

## **Hobbies and etc**
### I am a big fan of korean and chinese novels and stories, during my free time I read a lot of novels which has helped me greatly in expanding my vocabulary. I don't really know which one is my favorite, but if I had to choose one, it would most probably be [*Shadow Slave*](https://shadowslave.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Slave_Wiki). The name of this novel was the inspiration behind my gaming nickname **Shadow**, which was further influenced by the popular manga [*One Piece*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece) and instead became **Shadow D. White**. I use that nickname to this day.

## **Why?**
### Why did I enroll into [*Hitachi Highschool*](https://vasteras.hitachigymnasiet.se/) in particular? Well to tell you the truth my choice of Highschool was greatly impacted by my older brother who graduated the said Highschool 3 year ago.
